# homework-5-day-planner

Project Name: Day Planner

Description: 
    This is the fifth homework assignment for the Georgia Tech coding bootcamp. In this project, I created a simple day planner that shows the current day, month, date, and year at the top of the page. The scheduler includes typical business hours (9am-5pm) and allows the user to type into a form to write out their schedule for each hour of the day. 
    
    When the user adds an event to their schedule, they can click the save button and their event will be stored in local storage. When the page is refreshed, the event logged will remain on the page. 

    The scheduler's time blocks are color-coded to correspond with the current time. Time blocks that are in the past are shown as gray. Time blocks that are in the present are shown as pink/coral. Time blocks that are in the future are shown as bright green. The console shows the current time (based on a 24 hour clock), from javascript line 7. 

Feedback on my code: 
    One thing you will notice about my code is that I created a separate function for each time block for saving the inputs to local storage. This was very tedious! I tried to figure out how to write a for loop so that I wouldn't have to repeat code, but it did not work for some reason with the class I created for each input block. It only seemed to work with an ID. You can see the code I attempted to write, with the for loop, which I commented out. 
    
    Thank you for grading my homework! I appreciate your comments and suggestions for how to improve this project.
