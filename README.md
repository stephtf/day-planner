# Day Planner

## Description
    This project is a simple day planner that shows the current day, month, date, and year at the top of the page. The scheduler includes typical business hours (9am-5pm) and allows the user to type into a form to write out their schedule for each hour of the day. 
    
    When the user adds an event to their schedule, they can click the save button and their event will be stored in local storage. When the page is refreshed, the event logged will remain on the page. 

    The scheduler's time blocks are color-coded to correspond with the current time. Time blocks that are in the past are shown as gray. Time blocks that are in the present are shown as coral. Time blocks that are in the future are shown as bright green. The console shows the current time (based on a 24 hour clock).
